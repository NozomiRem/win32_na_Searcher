License_Text2 - ==============================================================================<br>FreeType　2.5.4<br><br>                    The FreeType Project LICENSE<br>                    ----------------------------<br><br>                            2006-Jan-27<br><br>                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by<br>          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg<br><br><br><br>Introduction<br>============<br><br>  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;<br>  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,<br>  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the<br>  FreeType Project.<br><br>  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and<br>  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license<br>  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,<br>  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.<br><br>  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG<br>  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion<br>  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products<br>  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:<br><br>    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be<br>      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)<br><br>    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or<br>      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)<br><br>    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use<br>      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge<br>      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the<br>      FreeType code. (`credits')<br><br>  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this<br>  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.<br>  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and<br>  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.<br><br><br>  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a<br>  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus<br>  encourage you to use the following text:<br><br>   """<br>    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType<br>    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.<br>   """<br><br>  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you<br>  actually use.<br><br><br>Legal Terms<br>===========<br><br>0. Definitions<br>--------------<br><br>  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',<br>  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally<br>  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and<br>  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,<br>  beta or final release.<br><br>  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where<br>  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source<br>  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.<br>  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType<br>  engine'.<br><br>  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original<br>  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and<br>  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its<br>  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.<br>  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by<br>  this license, you must contact us to verify this.<br><br>  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,<br>  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.

The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,<br>      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source<br>      files.<br><br>    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that<br>      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the<br>      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also<br>      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your<br>      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.<br><br>  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on<br>  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use<br>  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid<br>  to us.<br><br>3. Advertising<br>--------------<br><br>  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use<br>  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional<br>  purposes without specific prior written permission.<br><br>  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the<br>  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation<br>  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',<br>  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.<br><br>  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to<br>  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted<br>  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the<br>  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.<br>  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType<br>  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms<br>  of this license.<br><br>4.

License_Text2 - ==============================================================================<br>FreeType　2.5.4<br><br>                    The FreeType Project LICENSE<br>                    ----------------------------<br><br>                            2006-Jan-27<br><br>                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by<br>          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg<br><br><br><br>Introduction<br>============<br><br>  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;<br>  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,<br>  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the<br>  FreeType Project.<br><br>  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and<br>  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license<br>  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,<br>  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.<br><br>  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG<br>  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion<br>  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products<br>  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:<br><br>    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be<br>      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)<br><br>    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or<br>      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)<br><br>    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use<br>      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge<br>      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the<br>      FreeType code. (`credits')<br><br>  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this<br>  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.<br>  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and<br>  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.<br><br><br>  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a<br>  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus<br>  encourage you to use the following text:<br><br>   """<br>    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType<br>    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.<br>   """<br><br>  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you<br>  actually use.<br><br><br>Legal Terms<br>===========<br><br>0.

The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,<br>      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source<br>      files.<br><br>    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that<br>      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the<br>      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also<br>      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your<br>      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.<br><br>  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on<br>  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use<br>  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid<br>  to us.<br><br>3. Advertising<br>--------------<br><br>  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use<br>  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional<br>  purposes without specific prior written permission.<br><br>  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the<br>  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation<br>  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',<br>  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.<br><br>  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to<br>  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted<br>  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the<br>  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.<br>  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType<br>  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms<br>  of this license.<br><br>4.
