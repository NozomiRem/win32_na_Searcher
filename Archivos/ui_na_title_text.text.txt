If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Services or Collective Content, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Services or Collective Content, as applicable.<br>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, OR BY DOWNLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THESE TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED THROUGH THE SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR COLLECTIVE CONTENT. If you accept or agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms and, in such event, ""you"" and ""your"" will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.<br>MODIFICATION<br>SEGA reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate the Services or to modify these Terms, at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification via the Services or provide you with notice of the modification. We will also update the ""Last Updated Date"" at the top of these Terms. By continuing to access or use Services after we have posted a modification via the Services or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to stop using the Services.<br>ELIGIBILITY<br>The Services are intended solely for persons who are 13 or older. Any access to or use of the Services by anyone under 13 is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Services you represent and warrant that you are 13 or older.<br>ACCOUNT REGISTRATION<br>In order to access certain features of the Services and to post any User Content on or through the Services, you may be required to register to create an account (""Account""). You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. SEGA reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify SEGA of any unauthorized use of your Account.<br>You may not purchase, sell, gift or trade any Account, or offer to do same and any such attempt will be null and void. You agree that you have no right to or title in or to any Collective Content (excluding your User Content provided by you), including without limitation, any Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods (defined below) originating in the Services, or any other attributes associated with your Account, except as expressly provided in these Terms.<br>IN-SERVICES CURRENCIES AND GOODS<br>The Services may include a virtual, in-Services currency (""Virtual Currency""). Virtual Currency may be (i) obtained through gameplay within the Services, <br>(ii) purchased from SEGA for ""real world"" money if you are a legal adult in your country of residence, (iii) obtained by exchanging credits or other virtual items from the third party websites through which the Services are available for the Virtual Currency, so long as such an exchange is permitted by the applicable third party website, or (iv) obtained through interaction or participation with certain third-party advertisements and services. SEGA has no control over how such third party websites operate a system of credits or virtual items and whether or not such credits or virtual items can be exchanged with the Virtual Currency, so this method of obtaining Virtual Currency may not always be available to you. In addition, SEGA's Virtual Currency is made available to you at the sole discretion of SEGA and may be discontinued at any time. The Services may also include virtual, in-Services digital items and/or other virtual, in-Services goods and services (collectively, ""Virtual Goods"") that may be purchased from SEGA within the Services with Virtual Currency. Regardless of the terminology used, Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may never be redeemed with ""real world"" money, goods or other items of monetary value from SEGA or any other party.<br>Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency are digital items only. Your right to use any Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency that you obtain are limited to <br>a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, revocable right to use such Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency solely for your personal entertainment and non-commercial use and for no other purpose. Except for the limited rights described herein, you have no property interest or right or title in or to any such Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency, which remain the exclusive property of SEGA. As stated above, the existence of a particular offer of Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency is not a commitment by SEGA to maintain or continue to make the Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency available in the future. The scope, variety and type of Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency that you may obtain can change at any time. SEGA has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate such Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and SEGA will have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights.<br>Except where explicitly authorized by SEGA, (i) transfers of Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods are strictly prohibited; (ii) outside of the Services, you may not buy or sell any Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods for ""real world"" money or otherwise exchange items for value; and (iii) SEGA does not recognize any such purported transfers of Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods, nor the purported <br>sale, gift or trade in the ""real world"" of anything that appears in the Services. Any attempt to do any of the foregoing is in violation of these Terms and will result in an automatic termination of your rights to use the Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods and may result in termination of your Account, a lifetime ban from the Services and/or possible legal action. You agree that all sales of Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency are final. No refunds will be given, except in SEGA's sole and absolute discretion. All Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency are forfeited if your Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, in SEGA's sole and absolute discretion, or if SEGA discontinues providing the Services.<br>PAYMENT TERMS<br>Certain aspects of the Services are, or may in the future be, provided for a fee or other charge. In the event you choose to use paid aspects of the <br>Services, (e.g., if you decide to purchase Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods), you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies applicable to such fees and charges, as posted in the Services.

SEGA has no control over how such third party websites operate a system of credits or virtual items and whether or not such credits or virtual items can be exchanged with the Virtual Currency, so this method of obtaining Virtual Currency may not always be available to you. In addition, SEGA's Virtual Currency is made available to you at the sole discretion of SEGA and may be discontinued at any time. The Services may also include virtual, in-Services digital items and/or other virtual, in-Services goods and services (collectively, ""Virtual Goods"") that may be purchased from SEGA within the Services with Virtual Currency. Regardless of the terminology used, Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may never be redeemed with ""real world"" money, goods or other items of monetary value from SEGA or any other party.<br>Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency are digital items only. Your right to use any Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency that you obtain are limited to <br>a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, revocable right to use such Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency solely for your personal entertainment and non-commercial use and for no other purpose. Except for the limited rights described herein, you have no property interest or right or title in or to any such Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency, which remain the exclusive property of SEGA. As stated above, the existence of a particular offer of Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency is not a commitment by SEGA to maintain or continue to make the Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency available in the future. The scope, variety and type of Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency that you may obtain can change at any time. SEGA has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate such Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and SEGA will have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights.<br>Except where explicitly authorized by SEGA, (i) transfers of Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods are strictly prohibited; (ii) outside of the Services, you may not buy or sell any Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods for ""real world"" money or otherwise exchange items for value; and (iii) SEGA does not recognize any such purported transfers of Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods, nor the purported <br>sale, gift or trade in the ""real world"" of anything that appears in the Services. Any attempt to do any of the foregoing is in violation of these Terms and will result in an automatic termination of your rights to use the Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods and may result in termination of your Account, a lifetime ban from the Services and/or possible legal action. You agree that all sales of Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency are final. No refunds will be given, except in SEGA's sole and absolute discretion. All Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency are forfeited if your Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, in SEGA's sole and absolute discretion, or if SEGA discontinues providing the Services.<br>PAYMENT TERMS<br>Certain aspects of the Services are, or may in the future be, provided for a fee or other charge. In the event you choose to use paid aspects of the <br>Services, (e.g., if you decide to purchase Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods), you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies applicable to such fees and charges, as posted in the Services.

SEGA has no control over how such third party websites operate a system of credits or virtual items and whether or not such credits or virtual items can be exchanged with the Virtual Currency, so this method of obtaining Virtual Currency may not always be available to you. In addition, SEGA's Virtual Currency is made available to you at the sole discretion of SEGA and may be discontinued at any time. The Services may also include virtual, in-Services digital items and/or other virtual, in-Services goods and services (collectively, ""Virtual Goods"") that may be purchased from SEGA within the Services with Virtual Currency.

Any attempt to do any of the foregoing is in violation of these Terms and will result in an automatic termination of your rights to use the Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods and may result in termination of your Account, a lifetime ban from the Services and/or possible legal action. You agree that all sales of Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency are final. No refunds will be given, except in SEGA's sole and absolute discretion.
