text01 - そろそろ新年祭の時期だね！<br>みんなが楽しめるイベントにしたくて<br>色々な人に取材したんだけど……
11_voice_NPC_5121_104 - みんな、オメガの「幻惑の森」で<br>起きている騒ぎの対応で忙しいからって<br>つれない態度なの。
text03 - たしかに忙しいのは分かるし<br>「新年祭やってる場合なの？」って<br>思うかも知れないけど……
11_voice_NPC_5121_100 - でもでも、こんな時こそ<br>心に余裕を、みんなに笑顔をって<br>思うんだよね！
text05 - そこでお願いがあるの！<br>「幻惑の森」で起きている騒ぎについて<br>調べてきてもらえないかな？

text01 - It's about time for the New Year's Festival!<br>I tried to survey a lot of people so I could put<br>together an event they'd all enjoy...
11_voice_NPC_5121_104 - But nobody was in an answering mood! <br>They all said they were busy dealing with <br>the mess in the Omega Bewitched Woods.
text03 - Okay, so yeah, maybe things are busy.<br>Maybe you're thinking, "Is this any time for a<br>New Year's Festival?"
11_voice_NPC_5121_100 - Well, the answer is yes! Hard times are when<br>people most need opportunities to smile!
text05 - So I have a favor to ask! Could you look into<br>whatever's going on in the Bewitched Woods?
