ls_010030_0040 - So much it holds, too dear to part<br>may ways see the light of answers
ls_010030_0050 - For all was, once, just taken away<br>that one hope, all disappeared<br>(one hope, all disappeared)

ls_010030_0140 - When nothing breathes a hope of a chance<br>still, even then, until the end…
ls_010030_0150 - Phantasy stars in universe, they shine on<br>filling the sky with lights afloat, they shine on
ls_010030_0160 - Many a fray to keep aglow<br>only to stand against it all, they shine on

ls_010030_0210 - When all had gone, I had seen the end<br>you somehow reappeared
