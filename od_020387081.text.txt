11_voice_NPC_5087_104 - 特訓にもいろいろあると思うけど<br>的に当ててるだけじゃバレットボウは<br>上達しないんじゃないかなー？
text02 - 強い敵を仕留めることが<br>上達への近道だと思うんだー。
text03 - そこでわたしが考えた訓練メニューは<br>ヴォル・ドラゴンを仕留めること！<br>難しそうでしょー？
text04 - よっぽど心を落ち着けていかないと<br>当てても仕留められないかもよー？

11_voice_NPC_5087_104 - There are all sorts of ways you can go about<br>doing some serious bow training, but just<br>hitting targets isn't gonna cut it, is it?
text02 - But if you were to take on some really strong<br>enemies? That should get you improving fast!
text03 - So that's why my training regimen includes<br>taking down a Vol Dragon instead!<br>Sounds tough, right?
text04 - You're going to really have to compose<br>yourself, because not just any hit you land is<br>going to take that thing down.
