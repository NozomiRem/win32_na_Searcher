text01 - Nothing special about being decent with<br>a Launcher. Plenty of people could hit the side<br>of a barn.
11_voice_NPC_5054_100 - But you know what's rare? Someone with a<br>Launcher who sees their duty through to the <br>end and doesn't get a big ego about it.
text03 - Go out on this Dragon X hunt and <br>show me you can still be humble <br>when you come back here.
