un_032020_0010 - 死んで……死んでしまいますわ……<br>あの特訓お馬鹿さん、どこまで<br>特訓がお好きなんですの……
un_032020_0020 - ……ああ<br><%me>様！<br>どうか私をお助け下さい！
un_032020_0030 - <%me><br>気遣いは無用だ。<br>これはカトリの任務でもある。
un_032020_0040 - 実地での戦闘や、訓練も含めて<br>試験運用対象の義務だ。<br>最初に説明を受けただろう？
un_032020_0050 - 確かに説明は受けましたが<br>ここまで厳しいという話では<br>ありませんでしたわよ……
un_032020_0060 - それはお前が未熟だからだ。<br>現に私は呼吸一つ乱れていない。
un_032020_0070 - ……貴方のようなフィジカルエリートと<br>か弱い私を同列に考えないでくださる？
un_032020_0080 - だが、それでも希望したのはお前だ。<br>辞めるのなら、私は止めはしない。
un_032020_0090 - ……あーもうわかりました。<br>やればいいのでしょう、やれば。
un_032020_0100 - <%me>様！<br>私の頑張り、見ていてくださいね！
un_032020_0110 - ……あいつは呼吸をするように<br>弱音を吐く。<br>付き合えばつけあがるぞ。
un_032020_0120 - ではな。

un_032020_0010 - Die. Just die already, would you? <br>Honestly, just how far is this boot <br>camp loon planning to go?
un_032020_0020 - Oh my! It's you! Would you be <br>so kind as to lend me a hand?
un_032020_0030 - You need not bother. This is <br>part of Katori's mission.
un_032020_0040 - We have been over this. As a test <br>subject, you are obligated to engage <br>in both real battles and training alike.
un_032020_0050 - Yes, I'm well aware. But I do wish <br>someone would have told me how <br>dreadful this all was going to be.
un_032020_0060 - This would be nothing if you were better <br>prepared, as evidenced by how easily I still <br>draw breath as you struggle to catch yours.
un_032020_0070 - I would appreciate it if you did not assume <br>a fragile girl like me could keep up with <br>a fitness elite like yourself.
un_032020_0080 - You asked for this to begin with. If you <br>want to end it here, I will not stop you.
un_032020_0090 - Ugh. Fine, fine. Let's just get <br>on with it, then, shall we?
un_032020_0100 - Do be sure to watch as I do my very best!
un_032020_0110 - She complains nearly as often as <br>she breathes. Nothing good will <br>come from hanging around her <br>while she does, I promise.
un_032020_0120 - Farewell, then.
